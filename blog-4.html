		<h1>Digital Resolutions</h1>
			<p class="blog-text">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got really, really into Roni Size last year, particularly the debut of Roni Size & Reprazent <i>New Forms</i>. There's a track on there called 'Digital', and while it doesn't have much to lyrically dig into, it makes me think of a time when <i>The Digital</i> was something cool and transgressive (<i>I'm going to pretend I wasn't a child for most of this era of the internet</i>). It's not exactly novel to say that nowadays the internet has all but been commandeered by capitalist interests; I'm not sure if I quite subscribe to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory" target="blank">Dead Internet theory</a>, but I would be lying if I didn't say using the internet is a mostly pointless and exhausting pasttime for me nowadays. Despite all the potential freedom we could have to make our own little networked worlds, we've relinquished ourselves to these centralised platforms. For further reading I'd recommend having a look at <a href="https://zonelets.net/" target="blank">Zonelets</a>, if you think HTML blogging is your bag but you're not sure where to start. Some people with huge online followings don't even <i>have</i> a website, and here I am obsessing oever the minutiae of mine's CSS stylesheet like a chump.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really, really, really hate my smartphone. Again, I'm sure this isn't an uncommon sentiment among people of my age bracket. People like to throw around the thought experiment <i>"would you go back time to kill baby Hitler"</i>, but would I go back in time and stop Apple from inventing the iPhone? I'm not saying I'd kill Steve Jobs; the iPod was great, but imagine a world where Apple kept making iPods and smartphones never progressed past Blackberries (those things were extremely lame and we could've kept it that way). [...] I'm not gonna be ditching my smartphone anytime soon - I'm not an idiot - but I do feel like we can all agree; fuck the fastness, fuck the [...]

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind I'm choosing to focus less on social media, 'internet presence' and algorithms and instead on small interactions, friends and logging off. I have on multiple occasions tried to get my blog groove back - I was a pretty avid music writing hobbyist back in my late teens - and hopefully a little public diary in the corner of my website is the way to do it. I plan on using this to compile any longform thoughts on media, life and creating things; in the future, if anyone cares to read it, I'd love to write some postmortems on projects I've been involved with too. I love hearing others talk about their processes, and perhaps going through my own will help me figure things out too. I want these posts to be quickly-written, stream-of-consciousness style posts that I don't spend ages agonising over, and will minimally edit them.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's funny how with my move to Tokyo, I've accidentally been neglecting social media more and more, simply because <i>real world</i> has been taking up more and more time. [...]
			Start a blog, replace your site builder-ass website with something lightweight and messy you made in a text editor, go out and log off.
